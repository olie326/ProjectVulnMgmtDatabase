  - Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop applications on Linux.
    Versions prior to 1.10.8, 1.12.8, 1.14.4, and 1.15.4 contain a vulnerability similar to CVE-2017-5226, but     using the `TIOCLINUX` ioctl command instead of `TIOCSTI`. If a Flatpak app is run on a Linux virtual     console such as `/dev/tty1`, it can copy text from the virtual console and paste it into the command     buffer, from which the command might be run after the Flatpak app has exited. Ordinary graphical terminal     emulators like xterm, gnome-terminal and Konsole are unaffected. This vulnerability is specific to the     Linux virtual consoles `/dev/tty1`, `/dev/tty2` and so on. A patch is available in versions 1.10.8,     1.12.8, 1.14.4, and 1.15.4. As a workaround, don't run Flatpak on a Linux virtual console. Flatpak is     primarily designed to be used in a Wayland or X11 graphical environment. (CVE-2023-28100)

  - Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed desktop applications on Linux. In     versions prior to 1.10.8, 1.12.8, 1.14.4, and 1.15.4, if an attacker publishes a Flatpak app with elevated     permissions, they can hide those permissions from users of the `flatpak(1)` command-line interface by     setting other permissions to crafted values that contain non-printable control characters such as `ESC`. A     fix is available in versions 1.10.8, 1.12.8, 1.14.4, and 1.15.4. As a workaround, use a GUI like GNOME     Software rather than the command-line interface, or only install apps whose maintainers you trust.

  - In net/http in Go before 1.18.6 and 1.19.x before 1.19.1, attackers can cause a denial of service because     an HTTP/2 connection can hang during closing if shutdown were preempted by a fatal error. (CVE-2022-27664)

  - Non-random values for ticket_age_add in session tickets in crypto/tls before Go 1.17.11 and Go 1.18.3     allow an attacker that can observe TLS handshakes to correlate successive connections by comparing ticket     ages during session resumption. (CVE-2022-30629)

  - Uncontrolled recursion in Glob in io/fs before Go 1.17.12 and Go 1.18.4 allows an attacker to cause a     panic due to stack exhaustion via a path which contains a large number of path separators.

  - Uncontrolled recursion in Unmarshal in encoding/xml before Go 1.17.12 and Go 1.18.4 allows an attacker to     cause a panic due to stack exhaustion via unmarshalling an XML document into a Go struct which has a     nested field that uses the 'any' field tag. (CVE-2022-30633)

  - Uncontrolled recursion in Decoder.Decode in encoding/gob before Go 1.17.12 and Go 1.18.4 allows an     attacker to cause a panic due to stack exhaustion via a message which contains deeply nested structures.
    (CVE-2022-30635)

  - Improper exposure of client IP addresses in net/http before Go 1.17.12 and Go 1.18.4 can be triggered by     calling httputil.ReverseProxy.ServeHTTP with a Request.Header map containing a nil value for the     X-Forwarded-For header, which causes ReverseProxy to set the client IP as the value of the X-Forwarded-For     header.

  - A too-short encoded message can cause a panic in Float.GobDecode and Rat GobDecode in math/big in Go     before 1.17.13 and 1.18.5, potentially allowing a denial of service. (CVE-2022-32189)

  - An attacker can cause excessive memory growth in a Go server accepting HTTP/2 requests. HTTP/2 server     connections contain a cache of HTTP header keys sent by the client. While the total number of entries in     this cache is capped, an attacker sending very large keys can cause the server to allocate approximately     64 MiB per open connection. (CVE-2022-41717)

  - A Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) flaw was found in podman. This issue may allow a malicious user to     replace a normal file in a volume with a symlink while exporting the volume, allowing for access to     arbitrary files on the host file system. (CVE-2023-0778)

  - cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic primitives and recipes to Python developers. In     affected versions `Cipher.update_into` would accept Python objects which implement the buffer protocol,     but provide only immutable buffers. This would allow immutable objects (such as `bytes`) to be mutated,     thus violating fundamental rules of Python and resulting in corrupted output. This now correctly raises an     exception.

  - Parsing malicious or large YAML documents can consume excessive amounts of CPU or memory. (CVE-2022-3064)

  - A maliciously crafted HTTP/2 stream could cause excessive CPU consumption in the HPACK decoder, sufficient     to cause a denial of service from a small number of small requests. (CVE-2022-41723)

  - Large handshake records may cause panics in crypto/tls. Both clients and servers may send large TLS     handshake records which cause servers and clients, respectively, to panic when attempting to construct     responses. This affects all TLS 1.3 clients, TLS 1.2 clients which explicitly enable session resumption     (by setting Config.ClientSessionCache to a non-nil value), and TLS 1.3 servers which request client     certificates (by setting Config.ClientAuth >= RequestClientCert). (CVE-2022-41724)

  - A denial of service is possible from excessive resource consumption in net/http and mime/multipart.
    Multipart form parsing with mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm can consume largely unlimited amounts of memory     and disk files. This also affects form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile,     FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. ReadForm takes a maxMemory parameter, and is documented     as storing up to maxMemory bytes +10MB (reserved for non-file parts) in memory. File parts which cannot     be stored in memory are stored on disk in temporary files. The unconfigurable 10MB reserved for non-file     parts is excessively large and can potentially open a denial of service vector on its own. However,     ReadForm did not properly account for all memory consumed by a parsed form, such as map entry overhead,     part names, and MIME headers, permitting a maliciously crafted form to consume well over 10MB. In     addition, ReadForm contained no limit on the number of disk files created, permitting a relatively small     request body to create a large number of disk temporary files. With fix, ReadForm now properly accounts     for various forms of memory overhead, and should now stay within its documented limit of 10MB + maxMemory     bytes of memory consumption. Users should still be aware that this limit is high and may still be     hazardous. In addition, ReadForm now creates at most one on-disk temporary file, combining multiple form     parts into a single temporary file. The mime/multipart.File interface type's documentation states, If     stored on disk, the File's underlying concrete type will be an *os.File.. This is no longer the case when     a form contains more than one file part, due to this coalescing of parts into a single file. The previous     behavior of using distinct files for each form part may be reenabled with the environment variable     GODEBUG=multipartfiles=distinct. Users should be aware that multipart.ReadForm and the http.Request     methods that call it do not limit the amount of disk consumed by temporary files. Callers can limit the     size of form data with http.MaxBytesReader. (CVE-2022-41725)

  - HTTP and MIME header parsing can allocate large amounts of memory, even when parsing small inputs,     potentially leading to a denial of service. Certain unusual patterns of input data can cause the common     function used to parse HTTP and MIME headers to allocate substantially more memory than required to hold     the parsed headers. An attacker can exploit this behavior to cause an HTTP server to allocate large     amounts of memory from a small request, potentially leading to memory exhaustion and a denial of service.
    With fix, header parsing now correctly allocates only the memory required to hold parsed headers.
    (CVE-2023-24534)

  - Multipart form parsing can consume large amounts of CPU and memory when processing form inputs containing     very large numbers of parts. This stems from several causes: 1. mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm limits the     total memory a parsed multipart form can consume. ReadForm can undercount the amount of memory consumed,     leading it to accept larger inputs than intended. 2. Limiting total memory does not account for increased     pressure on the garbage collector from large numbers of small allocations in forms with many parts. 3.
    ReadForm can allocate a large number of short-lived buffers, further increasing pressure on the garbage     collector. The combination of these factors can permit an attacker to cause an program that parses     multipart forms to consume large amounts of CPU and memory, potentially resulting in a denial of service.
    This affects programs that use mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm, as well as form parsing in the net/http     package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. With fix,     ReadForm now does a better job of estimating the memory consumption of parsed forms, and performs many     fewer short-lived allocations. In addition, the fixed mime/multipart.Reader imposes the following limits     on the size of parsed forms: 1. Forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 1000 parts. This limit     may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxparts=. 2. Form parts parsed with     NextPart and NextRawPart may contain no more than 10,000 header fields. In addition, forms parsed with     ReadForm may contain no more than 10,000 header fields across all parts. This limit may be adjusted with     the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxheaders=. (CVE-2023-24536)

  - Calling any of the Parse functions on Go source code which contains //line directives with very large line     numbers can cause an infinite loop due to integer overflow. (CVE-2023-24537)

  - Templates do not properly consider backticks (`) as Javascript string delimiters, and do not escape them     as expected. Backticks are used, since ES6, for JS template literals. If a template contains a Go template     action within a Javascript template literal, the contents of the action can be used to terminate the     literal, injecting arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template. As ES6 template literals are rather     complex, and themselves can do string interpolation, the decision was made to simply disallow Go template     actions from being used inside of them (e.g. var a = {{.}}), since there is no obviously safe way to     allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix, Template.Parse     returns an Error when it encounters templates like this, with an ErrorCode of value 12. This ErrorCode is     currently unexported, but will be exported in the release of Go 1.21. Users who rely on the previous     behavior can re-enable it using the GODEBUG flag jstmpllitinterp=1, with the caveat that backticks will     now be escaped. This should be used with caution. (CVE-2023-24538)

  - Angle brackets (<>) are not considered dangerous characters when inserted into CSS contexts. Templates     containing multiple actions separated by a '/' character can result in unexpectedly closing the CSS     context and allowing for injection of unexpected HTML, if executed with untrusted input. (CVE-2023-24539)

  - Not all valid JavaScript whitespace characters are considered to be whitespace. Templates containing     whitespace characters outside of the character set \t\n\f\r\u0020\u2028\u2029 in JavaScript contexts     that also contain actions may not be properly sanitized during execution. (CVE-2023-24540)

  - containerd is an open source container runtime. A bug was found in containerd prior to versions 1.6.18 and     1.5.18 where supplementary groups are not set up properly inside a container. If an attacker has direct     access to a container and manipulates their supplementary group access, they may be able to use     supplementary group access to bypass primary group restrictions in some cases, potentially gaining access     to sensitive information or gaining the ability to execute code in that container. Downstream applications     that use the containerd client library may be affected as well. This bug has been fixed in containerd     v1.6.18 and v.1.5.18. Users should update to these versions and recreate containers to resolve this issue.
    Users who rely on a downstream application that uses containerd's client library should check that     application for a separate advisory and instructions. As a workaround, ensure that the `USER $USERNAME`     Dockerfile instruction is not used. Instead, set the container entrypoint to a value similar to     `ENTRYPOINT [su, -, user]` to allow `su` to properly set up supplementary groups. (CVE-2023-25173)

  - runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI specification. In affected     versions it was found that rootless runc makes `/sys/fs/cgroup` writable in following conditons: 1. when     runc is executed inside the user namespace, and the `config.json` does not specify the cgroup namespace to     be unshared (e.g.., `(docker|podman|nerdctl) run --cgroupns=host`, with Rootless Docker/Podman/nerdctl) or     2. when runc is executed outside the user namespace, and `/sys` is mounted with `rbind, ro` (e.g., `runc     spec --rootless`; this condition is very rare). A container may gain the write access to user-owned cgroup     hierarchy `/sys/fs/cgroup/user.slice/...` on the host . Other users's cgroup hierarchies are not affected.
    Users are advised to upgrade to version 1.1.5. Users unable to upgrade may unshare the cgroup namespace     (`(docker|podman|nerdctl) run --cgroupns=private)`. This is the default behavior of Docker/Podman/nerdctl     on cgroup v2 hosts. or add `/sys/fs/cgroup` to `maskedPaths`. (CVE-2023-25809)

  - runc through 1.1.4 has Incorrect Access Control leading to Escalation of Privileges, related to     libcontainer/rootfs_linux.go. To exploit this, an attacker must be able to spawn two containers with     custom volume-mount configurations, and be able to run custom images. NOTE: this issue exists because of a     CVE-2019-19921 regression. (CVE-2023-27561)

  - runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI specification. It was found     that AppArmor can be bypassed when `/proc` inside the container is symlinked with a specific mount     configuration. This issue has been fixed in runc version 1.1.5, by prohibiting symlinked `/proc`. See PR     #3785 for details. users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should avoid using an untrusted     container image. (CVE-2023-28642)

  - Templates containing actions in unquoted HTML attributes (e.g. attr={{.}}) executed with empty input can     result in output with unexpected results when parsed due to HTML normalization rules. This may allow     injection of arbitrary attributes into tags. (CVE-2023-29400)

  - The HTTP/1 client does not fully validate the contents of the Host header. A maliciously crafted Host     header can inject additional headers or entire requests. With fix, the HTTP/1 client now refuses to send     requests containing an invalid Request.Host or Request.URL.Host value. (CVE-2023-29406)

  - Text nodes not in the HTML namespace are incorrectly literally rendered, causing text which should be     escaped to not be. This could lead to an XSS attack. (CVE-2023-3978)

  - The code that processes control channel messages sent to `named` calls certain functions recursively     during packet parsing. Recursion depth is only limited by the maximum accepted packet size; depending on     the environment, this may cause the packet-parsing code to run out of available stack memory, causing     `named` to terminate unexpectedly.

  - A flaw was found in glibc. When the getaddrinfo function is called with the AF_UNSPEC address family and     the system is configured with no-aaaa mode via /etc/resolv.conf, a DNS response via TCP larger than 2048     bytes can potentially disclose stack contents through the function returned address data, and may cause a     crash. (CVE-2023-4527)

  - A flaw was found in glibc. In an extremely rare situation, the getaddrinfo function may access memory that     has been freed, resulting in an application crash. This issue is only exploitable when a NSS module     implements only the _nss_*_gethostbyname2_r and _nss_*_getcanonname_r hooks without implementing the
    _nss_*_gethostbyname3_r hook. The resolved name should return a large number of IPv6 and IPv4, and the     call to the getaddrinfo function should have the AF_INET6 address family with AI_CANONNAME, AI_ALL and     AI_V4MAPPED as flags. (CVE-2023-4806)

  - A flaw was found in glibc. In an uncommon situation, the gaih_inet function may use memory that has been     freed, resulting in an application crash. This issue is only exploitable when the getaddrinfo function is     called and the hosts database in /etc/nsswitch.conf is configured with SUCCESS=continue or SUCCESS=merge.
    (CVE-2023-4813)

  - A buffer overflow was discovered in the GNU C Library's dynamic loader ld.so while processing the     GLIBC_TUNABLES environment variable.

  - A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06.

This could allow arbitrary     code to be executed or a bypass of Secure Boot protections. The highest threat from this     vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.

  - A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. Setparam_prefix() in the menu     rendering code performs a length calculation on the assumption that expressing a quoted     single quote will require 3 characters, while it actually requires 4 characters which     allows an attacker to corrupt memory by one byte for each quote in the input.

The Windows Secure Boot forbidden signature database (DBX) did not contain the expected certificates.
When performing DBX updates exactly as illustrated in the vendor documentation, it is important to note that you are applying only the latest update. Updates applied in this manner may only appended to the DB, so you may still need to apply the older updates from the ""Archive of Prior Versions of DBX Files"" linked in the UEFI Revocation List File document (linked in the See Also advisory).
